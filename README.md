# Distributed and Graph Algorithms

Practice for some distributed and graph algorithms. The idea is the emulate a distributed network as reasonably as possible in order to properly implement things like leader election without cheating. Implementing something like Diffie-Hellman key exchange between nodes might be a thing to dip my toes into cryptography.

Ideally this turns into a reasonable testing platform for COMP4001 - Distributed Computing and COMP5900 - Multiagent Systems, and is useable for COMP2804 - Discrete Structures II and COMP3804 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms I
