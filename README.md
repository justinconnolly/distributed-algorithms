# Distributed and Graph Algorithms

Practice for some distributed and graph algorithms. Ideally this turns into a reasonable testing platform for COMP4001 - Distributed Computing and COMP5900 - Multiagent Systems and is useable for COMP2804 - Discrete Structures II and COMP3804 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms I

## TODO
DFS, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford, Minimum spanning tree (Prim's), Leader Election, Maybe flow

## DONE
Adding weighted edges, BFS
